# Assetto Corsa Telemetry

## About

ACT supports real time graphing and recording of telemetry data. It also has the ability to compare multiple recordings against each other. This enables the user to analyze every aspect of their laps, allowing them to optimize their driving techniques and ultimately achieving faster lap times.

## Installation

* Clone the library `git clone https://github.com/rangarajanpraneeth/ac-telemetry.git`
* Install the dependencies `npm i`
* Run the application `npm start`

## Common Issues

Sometimes the application will receive telemetry data very slowly or it could be laggy. In order to fix this, make sure Assetto Corsa is always opened first before the application.
